# what-i-read

I really got so many great ideas from web articles, some of them changed the trajectory of my timeline. And some of them I forgot, and for them, I created this repo so I will have a change to reread them more times.

I will provide links to videos that I believe are great because I have read their transcripts. If a brilliant mind does not write, watch their video or listen to their podcast.

The best way to memorize is to repeatedly read them.
